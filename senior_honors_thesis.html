            <h2>France in Focus: Exploring the Relationship between Proximity to Ethnic Enclaves and Anti-Immigrant Sentiment<br><small>(Undergraduate Senior Honors Thesis)</small></h2>
            <p>I designed and executed my honors thesis project to explore the relationship between proximity to ethnic enclaves and anti-immigrant sentiment using statistical and spatial analyses. For more details, please see the <strong><a href="pdf/JennaEpstein_SeniorHonorsThesis_Abstract.pdf" target="_blank">thesis abstract</a></strong> (or check out the entire <strong><a href="pdf/JennaEpstein_SeniorHonorsThesis_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">thesis paper</a></strong>).
            </p><br>
            <h3>Brief Context</h3>
            <p>In light of terror attacks over the past few years in Europe (specifically the November 2015 Paris attacks), coupled with the prominent debate on influx of migrants to the EU, my senior thesis research project focused on exploring key questions about coexistence of national citizens with immigrant counterparts in France.</p>
            <p>Given existing conflicting theories, my study tested two competing hypotheses: that proximity to concentrated ethnic groups increases anti-immigrant sentiment, and that proximity to concentrated ethnic groups decreases anti- immigrant sentiment. I used votes for the extreme-right 2012 presidential candidate Marine Le Pen of the Front National (FN) as a proxy for anti-immigrant sentiment.</p> 
            <br>
            <h3>Zooming In: Paris Case Study Map</h3>
            <p>For one element of my thesis project's analysis, I created a map of ethnic enclaves overlaid on percentages of Le Pen votes across all voting bureaus to provide an interactive platform for looking at the relationship between the variables. In order to map out these voting bureaus, I obtained a geospatial dataset for all of the voting bureaus from the 2012 French presidential election (on the <a href="https://opendata.paris.fr/page/home/" target="_blank">open data website for the city of Paris</a>). I joined this geospatial data for all arrondisement voting bureaus to the electoral voting results data for each one.</p>

<h4>Map Discussion</h4>
<p>The results portrayed on the map encourage further exploration to find out how to extract more conclusive evidence for what is going on in regards to in- and out-group interactions on the Parisian level. By providing a visual of Le Pen vote distribution overlaid with the ethnic enclaves, one can interpret interactions between the variables in a more comprehensive and impactful manner than through the numerical, not significant results from the statistical model. It is key, though, to look at the interactions occurring between voters in enclaves and their adjacent voting bureaus. In this way, results can then be interpreted in terms of sentiment towards specific ethnic and immigrant groups, instead of general anti-minority sentiment. Cases can be made supporting both hypotheses when looking at specific ethnic enclave bureaus and their interaction with adjacent ones, thus revealing that interactions of native French voters with certain ethnic groups affect their attitudes in different ways. However, given the absence of census data collected on immigrant origins, coupled with the reality that migrant flows are not always documented, evaluating the variable relationship according to specific immigrant ethnic group presence is not feasible at this time.</p>
